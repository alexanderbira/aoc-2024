# Advent of Code 2024

These are my solutions for the [2024 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) problems.

I'm aiming to write them in TypeScript, but I'll resort to JavaScript if the type system gets in my way. My only goal is to solve the problems, so I apologise in advance for any bad asymptotic time complexities.

## Getting Started
Install [Deno](https://deno.com).

Copy your input into `inputs/dayXX.txt`, where `XX` is the 2-digit day number.

Run:
```shell
deno task day X
```
where `X` is the day number.

The answer to part 1 and part 2 for the given input will be printed to the console, as well as the total runtime.
